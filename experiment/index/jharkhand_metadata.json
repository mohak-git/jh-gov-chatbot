The sector is credited for generating ample employment opportunities and promoting\nequitable distribution of natio nal income. Also, MSMEs contribute towards exports, entrepreneurial\ndevelopment and upliftment of rural and backward areas.  MSMEs are complementary to large\nindustries as ancillary units and this sector contributes significantly to the inclusive industrial\ndevelopment of the country. Next to agriculture, MSME sector has potential of tapping individuals to\nassociate with economic activities by way of self -employment.\nMSMEs are the backbone of Indian economy contributing to approx 26.83%  of the GDP and 49.35%  of\ntotal exports. As per Udyam portal, more than 1.24 Crore  MSMEs are registered on Udyam providing\nemployment to more than 8.83 Crore  people, as on 1st January 2023.  In",

INTRODUCTION\nHistorically, advancements in the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) technology have driven growth in\nthe automobile sector, but lately, a host of factors including global warming, climate consciousness\nand improvements in battery storage capacity etc. have ushered in a shift towards electric Vehicles\n(EV). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its latest report1 has already warned\nthat climate change is already ‘irreversible’ for centuries to millennia, ahead. Thus, to ensure\nsustainability, it is imperative that the future of transportation is electric with zero emissions and\ncarbon footprint.\nIndia is actively exploring cost-effective and viable solutions for sustainable development as well as\nreducing its excessive dependence on oil imports.

However, the EV market has the potential to grow\nsignificantly in the coming years, as sales are expected to witness high double-digit growth rates\nannually till 2030. EVs have emerged as a promising and singular alternative that could help mitigate\nthe adverse environmental impact caused by conventional vehicles.\nTo further drive the growth of EV sector in the country, the Government of India is increasingly\npushing to develop appropriate monetary and fiscal responses to promote drive EV adoption in the\ncountry. A differential GST regime for EVs has been implemented by the Government of India as it is\nexpected to help electric mobility gain momentum, under it, pure EVs have been kept in the 5% tax\nslab of the GST.\nJharkhand, in the pursuit of giving fillip to the shift from fossil fuel based medium of transportation to\nthe electric medium with zero emissions and carbon footprint, trying to create ",

Due deliberations have been done to ensure that\nthe suite of fisc\nal and non -fiscal measures proposed in this policy are amongst the best in the\ncountry, with an aim to attract and promote Eth anol centric investment in the state.\n\n2. Ethanol Production in India\n\nEthanol, primarily known as common alcohol, also serves as a renewable biofuel. It is\nderived largely from fermentation of sugarcane juices, type B and C molasses, damaged food\ngrains with  high starch content such as wheat and sorghum alongside still nascent methods\nlike algae processing and chemical treatment of CO2 and H2O. Blending of bio ethanol with\npetroleum serves a multitude of purposes including but not limited to, reduced vehicula r\nemissions and energy security by using renewable energy.\nIndia has around 330 distilleries, which can produce over 4.8 billion litres of rectified spirits\n(alcohol) per year. Of this total, about 166 distilleries have the capacity to distil 2.6 billion\nlitres of ethanol (denatured and undenatured) to be used in fuel, industrial chemicals, and\nbeverage",

Jharkhand’s proximity to the\nSeaports viz. Kolkata (400 km from Ranchi), Haldia (420 km from Ranchi), Paradip (560 km from\nRanchi), and a Dry-Port at Jamshedpur, make the Sta te an attractive destination for Export Oriented\nUnits (EOUs). Due to its location near the Eastern seaboard of India, the state is well-placed to serv e\nthe ‘Act East’ policy of the Government of India. I t offers considerable freight and time advantage to\nentrepreneurs interested in doing business with the  South East Asian and East Asian markets.\nJharkhand offers excellent rail and road connectivi ty to the rest of India.

These rights safeguard intangible assets such as\ninventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in\ncommerce. IPR ensures that creators can benefit from their work and encourages\ninnovation, creativity, and economic growth.\nHistory of IPR\nThe roots of IPR can be traced back to ancient civilizations. In Venice (1474), the first\npatent law was enacted. The Statute of Anne (1710) in England was the first copyright law.\nInternational agreements like the Paris Convention (1883) and the Berne Convention\n(1886) laid the foundation of modern IPR systems. Today, organizations like the World\nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and WTO-TRIPS ensure global coordination.\nTypes of IPR and Laws Associated\nThe major types of IPR include Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, Industrial Designs,\nGeographical Indications (GI), and Trade Secrets. Each type has its own laws in India:\nPatents Act, 1970; Copyright Act, 1957; Trade Marks Act, 1999; Designs Act, 2000; GI",

Cultural:\nSafeguards traditional knowledge. Knowledge Transfer: Promotes university-industry\ncollaboration. Technical: Boosts innovation in pharma, IT, and engineering.\nRecent Trends in IPR\nDigital Copyrights, AI and IPR, Covid-19 vaccine patent debates, Blockchain & NFTs, and\nstricter enforcement are major recent trends.\nIPR in Global Scenario\nDeveloped nations emphasize strict IPR enforcement, while developing countries balance\npublic interest.
